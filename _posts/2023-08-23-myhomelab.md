Hello world -- and welcome to Sysblob.com. My homelab began during covid in mid 2021. Fed up with never getting to work with servers directly, I purchased a Dell Poweredge R730, a rack, and began my adventure. Since then I've expanded to a 2nd poweredge server, 24 port switch and router, cloud servers, and countless other devices. My labbing self-hosted interests have spanned multimedia, enterprise infrastructure, automation, networking, coding and development, and so much more. This website is my attempt to document some of that and give back to the community. 

The goal os Sysblob.com is three fold:

- To teach concepts that can be difficult to grasp in a straight forward article based format.
- To provide direct how-to guides on performing setup and configuration items
- To showcase my more fun homelab projects
