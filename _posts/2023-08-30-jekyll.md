# Introduction

I've spent a lot of time building websites. When I was wee youngster I remember the thrill of logging into free template providers like Geocities or Angelfire that made it so easy. I was 12 or 13 at the time and mostly just wanted a website with a cool flame.gif border. As I became older I got interested in learning the code behind websites and studied HTML, CSS, and Javascript. As the  spent some time getting into web frameworks like django, flask, and react. I even spent some time with word press, and open source projects like Bookstack or Wiki.js. Building websites is something I really do enjoy. I think that's why when I was introduced to the Github world of website building, something really clicked with me.

## What is Jekyll?

Jekyll [https://jekyllrb.com/](https://jekyllrb.com/) is a static site generator made by Github. Jekyll takes plain text and markdown and converts it into beautiful websites. It does this by inserting your content into layouts that can easily be edited from configuration files. There are then themes which edit the layouts further into cohesive websites. This website, for example, uses Jekyll to generate static content using the theme called Chirpy found here [https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy).

## What is Github Pages?

Github Pages [https://pages.github.com/](https://pages.github.com/) was created with the idea of hosting a static website directly from your Github repository. Essentially as long as you have an index.html file at the base of your website directory you can push to github and host a website. Jekyll works great for this since you can write something like a blog post in plain text, mark it up with how you'd like it to look, generate the real website from that markdown, and upload it to Github. 

Does this interest you? Let's build it.

## Jekyll usage and tips

Here you will find some general guidelines on using Jekyll. For the most part Jekyll and Chirpy have great documentation so I will just be linking to them below. However, for some specific things I had to search a little harder for you can find those below as well.

Jekyll docs: [Jekyll page building](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/pages/)  
Chirpy docs: [Chirpy formatting](https://chirpy.cotes.page/posts/write-a-new-post/)

### How do I link to another post?

You can link another post internally by referencing it like below:

{% raw %}
```liquid
[link name here]({% post_url 2023-09-02-postname %})
```
{% endraw %}

### Using codeblock around template language
Sometimes you will encounter wanting to codeblock something that liquid (the template renderer of Jekyll) wants to render. You can avoid this and still make a code block by using raw and endraw around the codeblock.
