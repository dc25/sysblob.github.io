One thing I've spent a lot of time doing is building websites. When I was wee youngster I recall building websites using templates from sites like Angelfire or Geocities. Then I went through a phase where I tried to learn HTML, CSS, and Javascript and do it old school. I spent some time getting into web frameworks like django, flask, and react. I even spent some time with word press, and open source projects like Bookstack or Wiki.js. Building websites is something I really do enjoy. I think that's why when I was introduced to the Github world of website building, something really clicked with me.

Jekyll [https://jekyllrb.com/](https://jekyllrb.com/) is a static site generator made by Github. Jekyll takes plain text and markdown and converts it into beautiful websites. It does this by inserting your content into layouts that can easily be edited from configuration files. There are then themes which edit the layouts further into cohesive websites. This website, for example, uses Jekyll to generate static content using the theme called Chirpy found here [https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy).

Github Pages [https://pages.github.com/](https://pages.github.com/) was created with the idea of hosting a static website directly from your Github repository. Essentially as long as you have an index.html file at the base of your website directory you can push to github and host a website. Jekyll works great for this since you can write something like a blog post in plain text, mark it up with how you'd like it to look, generate the real website from that markdown, and upload it to Github. 

Does this interest you? Let's build it.

Coming soon.
