Everyone has seen a movie where a hacker is typing away on a black screen and code whizzes by. This is our ingrained image a computer super genius. The black screen is something called a terminal which allows you to enter commands that are interpreted directly into programs. Linux is famous for being a terminal heavy operating system, and one hackers and homelabbers alike love to run. Let's take a look at some of the concepts behind Linux.

## Introduction

You could write an entire book on the amount of knowledge there is to cover on Linux - and many people have. For this guide though I just want to cover some of the most basic concepts, and I'll reference material where other people do it better. I'm a big fan of learnlinux.tv as a website. Jay makes absolutely great content for everything linux. Speaking of which, if you've never installed a linux system before, here is his guide on Ubuntu linux so you have a baseline to work with.

## Linux Distributions

One of the things I wanted to cover that I found confusing when I first started using linux is the concepts of distributions and streams. Linux comes from the open source community, meaning it was created for free as an operating system. Since it was free and the code was available, many people created their own versions or `forks` of linux. We call these different coding forks distributions. The interesting thing is it didn't stop there. People then forked these distributions, which made forks of forks. When you have a chain of distributions which depend on each other we call this a stream. You can refer to a linux distribution as being `upstream` or `downstream` of another distribution. Let's look at the most famous linux stream as a concrete example.

Redhat Enterprise Linux or RHEL for short, is the de facto enterprise linux distribution. If linux is free you ask, how can a distribution be enterprise? Well, **support** is your answer. RHEL puts features and customer support infrastructure into their product so that they can charge money for a more substantial product. Companies like to know if something breaks someone will stand by it and help them.

Upstream of RHEL sits Fedora, the open source version of RHEL. The community, along with RHEL developers, actively contribute to the Fedora operating system. This code is then used and modified to become RHEL. This coding cycle continues, with one release based off another within the chain. Downstream of RHEL sits several other distributions such as Oracle Linux, Rocky Linux, and Alma Linux. The obvious question would be how can distributions like Rocky Linux take code from RHEL an enterprise version? This is exactly a problem in the linux distribution world. Another distribution, CentOS, used to be the official open-source downstream of RHEL and Rocky and Oracle were based off that. Recently RedHat made very controversial decisions to move CentOS upstream, and no longer make enterprise code available downstream. This has put distributions in a tricky spot where they want to remain 1:1 with RHEL, but struggle to gain insight into RHEL's codebase.

A list of some commonly known Linux distributions sometimes refered to as `flavors`:

- Rocky [https://rockylinux.org/](https://rockylinux.org/): Rocky strives to be a 1:1 downstream clone of RHEL.
- Alma [https://almalinux.org/](https://almalinux.org/): ABI compatible clone of RHEL.
- Oracle [https://www.oracle.com/linux/](https://www.oracle.com/linux/): Oracle's enhanced security Linux downstream of RHEL.
- Fedora [https://fedoraproject.org/](https://fedoraproject.org/): Upstream open-source of RHEL.
- CentOS Stream [https://www.centos.org/](https://www.centos.org/): Positioned midstream between Fedora and RHEL.
- Debian [https://www.debian.org/](https://www.debian.org/): Major RHEL alternative open-source stream which forms Ubuntu. 
- Ubuntu [https://ubuntu.com/](https://ubuntu.com/): Solid linux alternative to RHEL made by Canonical. First choice for a lot of homelabbers and downstream of debian.
- Arch [https://archlinux.org/](https://archlinux.org/): A distro based around constant rolling updates.
- Kali [https://www.kali.org/](https://www.kali.org/): A distro designed around hacking. Popular among penetration testers.

Most of these distros can come with a GUI or they can come as what we refer to as `headless` which basically means terminal only.
